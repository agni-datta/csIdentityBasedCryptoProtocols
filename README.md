# Identity-Based Cryptographic Protocols

## Description

A comprehensive implementation of identity-based cryptographic protocols including Schnorr identification schemes, Fiat-Shamir transformations, and zero-knowledge proofs. This repository serves as a practical resource for studying and implementing modern cryptographic primitives.

## Features

- Schnorr Identification Scheme
- Fiat-Shamir Transform
- Bilinear Pairings
- Age Proofs
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Analysis and benchmarking tools
