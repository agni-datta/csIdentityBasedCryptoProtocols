# README

This repository (ongoing) contains implementations of various identity-based cryptographic protocols in the field of computer science. Identity-based cryptography is a cryptographic technique where a user’s identity information, such as an email address or a username, can be directly used as a public key, eliminating the need for a separate public key infrastructure (PKI). This repository serves as a resource for studying, experimenting with, and understanding identity-based cryptographic protocols.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following identity-based cryptographic protocols:

1. **Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)**: An encryption scheme where the public key of a user is derived from their identity information.
2. **Identity-Based Signature (IBS)**: A digital signature scheme where the public key of a user is derived from their identity information.
3. **Identity-Based Key Agreement (IBKA)**: A key agreement protocol where two parties derive a shared secret key using their respective identity information.

Each protocol implementation is provided with detailed documentation and usage instructions.

## Usage

To use the implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the specific protocol you’re interested in.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the protocol’s documentation to compile and run the implementation.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you’d like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes or additions.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contributions.

Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the coding standards and conventions of the repository.
